#Miscellaneous Code Snippets

This repository is made to store code snippets to perform tasks that primarily reduce manual effort. At present it hosts:

1. [Library Bulk Installation](https://github.com/junaidali-b/misc_snippets/tree/main/Library_Bulk_Installation): This snippet is run within an R script, and is used to install all R libraries that I currently use, from a CSV file. This helps when you need to reset your system or change your machine. To me it was helpful while installing R on my Linux partition.
